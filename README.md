# cutejs/bashrc

## king of dotfiles

If you just want it all, you can run bin/install.sh which will copy it all to ~/lib/bashrc/

If you clone it there in the first place, setup.sh will not copy the bashrc files, but will
set up a helper bootstrapper called ~/.cutestrap as well as the code that sources it to your
.bashrc

If you'd prefer to make a symlink instead, use bin/link.sh

You might be better served just copying the bits you want into your own .bashrc

Mostly I want this in the cloud to keep my environment the same between computers.

With love,

Astrid.
