# cutejs/bashrc

## king of dotfiles

### Installation

There are 2 installers available in the `bin` directory: `link.sh` and `install.sh`

Link creates a symlink from wherever you cloned this repo to `~lib/bashrc`. This is the method
I use so I can keep my computers in sync with git. Since they're links, you can't move the files
without relinking.

Install copies these files into lib/bashrc. You can safely delete this repo after that. Just clone
it again and run install again to get fresh baked bashrc at your leisure.

### Honestly?

You might be better served just copying the bits you like into your own .bashrc

Mostly I want this in the cloud to keep my environment the same between computers.

With love,

Astrid.
