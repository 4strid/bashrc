# 4strid/bashrc

## queen of dotfiles

### Installation

There are 2 installers available in the `bin` directory: `link.sh` and `install.sh`

Link creates a symlink from wherever you cloned this repo to `~/lib/bashrc`. This is the method
I use so I can keep my computers in sync with git. Since they're links, you can't move the files
without relinking.

Install copies these files into `~/lib/bashrc`. You can safely delete this repo, but you'll
have to clone and run install again to get fresh baked bashrc.

### Honestly?

You might be better served just copying the bits you like into your own .bashrc
Especially interesting are the `cd+` and `tryhard` functions! You may find them quite useful,
if nothing else.

I've annotated everything with dependencies so copy/install those too or stuff will break.

(Mostly I want this in "the cloud" to keep my environment the same between computers.)
